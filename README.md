# mazeCrawler
Welcome to the source code for our COSC 465 Computer Networking Final Project Artifact. Here we designed an online game where players race to finish a randomly generated maze as fast as they can.

In order to run this on a machine of your own, there are a few things you should know. First, **this project is written in python version 3.** Also, you'll have to install a few packages:
1. Run `pip3 install pygame`

# Running the Game
1. Run `python3 Server_start.py`
1. Run `python3 client_start.py`
